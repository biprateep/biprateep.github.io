I am currently finishing up my PhD at the University of Pittsburgh. Beginning Fall 2024, I will be joining the [Department of Statistical Sciences](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/) of [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) as a [Schmidt AI for Science Fellow](https://www.schmidtfutures.org/our-work-old/schmidt-ai-in-science-postdocs/) and the [Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA)](https://www.cita.utoronto.ca/) as a CITA fellow.

My work involves developing statistical machine-learning tools to study the formation and evolution of the Universe and the galaxies within. I also work on designing large astronomical sky surveys which enable such statistical studies and am "[builder](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/collaboration/desi-builders/)" of the [Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) collaboration. I am also passionate about developing a scientific community which is accessible and welcoming to all.

You can find my publications along with an up-to-date citation record [here](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0002-5665-7912&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0).
