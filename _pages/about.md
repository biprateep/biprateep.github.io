I am currently finishing up my PhD at the Department of Physics and Astronomy of the University of Pittsburgh. Beginning Fall 2024, I will be joining the Department of Statistical Sciences of University of Toronto as a Schmidt AI for Science Fellow and the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) as a CITA fellow.

My research involves developing statistical machine learning methods to understand the formation and evolution of the Universe and the galaxies within. I am also interested in designing and implementing large scale astronomical surveys which facilitate such studies. I am a member of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration and have been involved in various aspects of the survey.
